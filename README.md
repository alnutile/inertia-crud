## TL;DR

I got sick of making the same thing over and over on projects, so I made a command to output my stub files, so I can with one command
have all the Inertia CRUD files needed. (DELETE is coming soon)

> Yes I know there are others out there, but I wanted one that fit my current workflow.

All you need to do is run the command: 

```bash 
php artisan inertia-crud:create Dog Dogs
```

And it will do the rest. 

>Yes I ask for the `Model` name capitalized and plural, so I do not have to code that logic.

Then you will have these files made:

```
app/Http/Controllers/DogController.php
tests/Features/Http/Controllers/DogControllerTest.php
resources/js/Pages/Dogs/Index.vue
resources/js/Pages/Dogs/Show.vue
resources/js/Pages/Dogs/Edit.vue
resources/js/Pages/Dogs/Create.vue
resources/js/Pages/Dogs/Components/ResourceForm.vue
```

And the routes will have:

```php 
Route::controller(\App\Http\Controllers\DogController::class)
    ->group(function () {
        Route::get('/dogs', 'index')->name('dogs.index');
        Route::get('/dogs/create', 'create')->name('dogs.create');
        Route::post('/dogs/create', 'store')->name('dogs.store');
        Route::get('/dogs/{dog}', 'show')->name('dogs.show');
        Route::get('/dogs/{dog}/edit', 'edit')->name('dogs.edit');
        Route::put('/dogs/{dog}', 'update')->name('dogs.update');
    });

```

## Overview

This will put some simple ready to go CRUD files into place, for Inertia. 

For example an Index page:

![](images/index.png)

>PHP Faker generated data in example btw

I just need to do is line up the fields and columns in the `Index.vue` file.

Then when someone pressed **Add** I need that page as well.

![](images/create.png)

You will see this has a select list. This shows a component I include, based on JetStream that
makes that easy as well.


The controller includes a test ðŸŽ‰

All these routes will be made as well, also including testse:

```php 
Route::controller(\App\Http\Controllers\OfficeController::class)
    ->group(function () {
        Route::get('/offices', 'index')->name('offices.index');
        Route::get('/offices/create', 'create')->name('offices.create');
        Route::post('/offices/create', 'store')->name('offices.store');
        Route::get('/offices/{office}', 'show')->name('offices.show');
        Route::get('/offices/{office}/edit', 'edit')->name('offices.edit');
        Route::put('/offices/{office}', 'update')->name('offices.update');
    });
```



This package assumes this layout.

  * `app/Http/Controllers` for the controllers
  * `routes/web.php` for the routes
  * `resources/js/Components` for a few of those
  * `resources/js/Pages/` to put the resource related Vue crud

On that note it assumes:
  * Tailwind
  * VueJS 3
  * Inertia 
  * vue-toastification

Some components come from JetStream, like almost all!

You may have to fix the `import AppLayout from '@/Layouts/AppLayout.vue';` in the files 
I will make that a config option later.

## TODO 
  * Add DELETE
  * Add config file for more options/paths etc
  * Add config option for the `AppLayout.vue`


## Installation
You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require alnutile/inertia-crud --dev

## Usage
